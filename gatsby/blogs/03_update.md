# First Update for WhatIsOnchain?

After a week break, I am back to update WhatIsOnchain?. This time, I had added 2 core features that I personally find it to be useful for while using Ethereum blockchain, which is ENS lookup and also Ether gas calculation.

## Feature 1: ENS Lookup

[Try out the feature](/coins/ethereum/ens)

A handy tool for you to get the address for an ENS domain.

## Feature 2: Ether Gas Calculation

By using API from https://ethgasstation.info/, I am able to pull out the current gas fee on Ethereum blockchain.
