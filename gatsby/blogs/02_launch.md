# What's next

WhatIsOnchain? was launch yesterday, I've collected a few feedbacks and here are a few things I am planning what to do next.

## Bi-weekly ETH Network call

I've join in the bi-weekly discord call on ETH Network by [@defidude](https://twitter.com/defidude)

Here's a summary of what happen:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">THREAD: The 4th ETH Network community Discord call concluded at just over an hour long.<br><br>We got to discuss some awesome projects! We had <a href="https://twitter.com/StaniKulechov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@StaniKulechov</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/AaveAave?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AaveAave</a> to introduce everyone to their new flash loan feature (awesome stuff), and even explain aTokens.<br><br>...</p>&mdash; DeFi Dude üç™ (defidude.eth) (@DeFiDude) <a href="https://twitter.com/DeFiDude/status/1218944349641367553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2020</a></blockquote>

Learn something about the defi space, and manage to get some of the defi users feedback about what to work on.

### Aave

Aave just launch recently, might be interesting to incoperate some of the core on chain data into the app as well! The flash loan concept is interesting, it allows multiple contract call in 1 transaction.

### DeFi onchain data

DeFi onchain data such as borrow rate, lending rate etc.

### DeFi platform details (something like DeFi Pulse)

I had created a prototype for querying on chain data in terms of total crypto locked in the ethereum blockchain. Might be interesting to add this into the app.

### F12Network

I would also consider creating a [F12 Discord group](https://f12.network/) for those who are interested into onchain data collecting and displaying.

## Daostack Alchemy

[My first Daostack Alchemy post](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x294f999356ed03347c7a23bcbcf8d33fa41dc830/proposal/0xb967781a8fbde196875d542ad223ff5b187740aac07db9212228c534256db96a) was posted yesterday. I've learn a bit about the [core value of Genesis Alpha Dao](https://medium.com/daostack/genesis-1-0-6184dffbfe8a).

## Gitcoin

I also made [my first gitcoin grant](https://gitcoin.co/grants/389/whatisonchain) and also funded my first gitcoin for FestDAO!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I just funded this grant on <a href="https://twitter.com/gitcoin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@gitcoin</a> =&gt; <a href="https://t.co/GoEKBGgxeF">https://t.co/GoEKBGgxeF</a></p>&mdash; superoo7 | superoo7.eth | superoo7.com (@jlwhoo7) <a href="https://twitter.com/jlwhoo7/status/1218914860701929472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2020</a></blockquote>

## Conclusion

I am grateful that I am able to reach out to the Ethereum community to learn more in depth knowledge about DAO and DeFi; I'll plan to add more feature onto the site in the next release!
