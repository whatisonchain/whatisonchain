# FAQ

## What is onchain?

This website is called "whatisonchain.com", you can checkout [the introduction post about this website](/blogs/introduction).

## What is onchain really?

I had previously work on an [NFT Wallet](https://nft-manager.netlify.com/) project and I realize that with power of modern day front end development skills, I can build a full fletch front end directly interacting with blockchain, which is also known as onchain data. So, this project was created from hobby, but also a way for me to experiment onchain data and make it into use for others.

## How do I give suggestion or feedback?
